## Open decisions

- **Transcription API:** Not yet chosen. To be decided at Phase 9.
- **n8n local development approach:** ngrok vs. Cloudflare Tunnel vs. local n8n in Docker Compose. To be decided and documented at Phase 9.

## Phase log

### Phase 1 — Repository structure (complete)

Created the top-level repository structure: `frontend/`, `n8n/`, `services/` (with `rag_service/`, `call_signal_analyser/`, `guardrails_service/`, `langgraph_agent/`), `data/`, `models/`, `docs/`, `demo/`. Added placeholder `README.md` files to every main folder, a top-level `README.md` with project overview, `CLAUDE.md` with the full project specification, this `PROGRESS.md` file, and a `.gitignore` covering Python, Node, React, Docker, environment variables, model files, audio files, and local data artifacts (e.g. ChromaDB data).

Confirmed by user. Committed as "Phase 1: Repository structure".

### Phase 2 — README and project documentation (in progress)

Expanded the top-level `README.md` into comprehensive project documentation (per user's choice of scope): added a "Why XSight" motivation section, detailed user personas, an example (abridged) output JSON, a system components section summarizing each service's role, an architecture overview, a documentation index table pointing to `CLAUDE.md` and planned Phase 3/4/20 docs, and a phase-grouped development roadmap table. Technology decisions and the detailed architecture diagram remain out of scope here — they are dedicated documents built in Phase 3 and Phase 4.

Awaiting user confirmation to mark Phase 2 complete.
